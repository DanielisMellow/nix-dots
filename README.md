# 🧬 nix-dots

My personal dotfiles for Linux, built to be portable, reproducible, and beautiful.  
This repo manages my terminal environment, Hyprland desktop config, dev tools, and theming — all installed with a single command.

> 🧠 Designed for use alongside my [NixOS system flake](https://github.com/DanielisMellow/nixos-config)

## 🚀 Quick Install

```bash
bash <(curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DanielisMellow/nix-dots/main/install.sh)

## 🛠️ Manual Installation

Prefer not to use `curl`? You can clone and run the installer manually:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DanielisMellow/nix-dots ~/.nix-dots
cd ~/.nix-dots
bash install.sh
